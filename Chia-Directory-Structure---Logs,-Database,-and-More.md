For all operating systems (OS), the location for you Chia directories (folders) that contain the database, configuration, logs, etc. is in directories inside your home folder.

# Home Directory
Most if not all of the Chia software's folders and data will be in your home directory. While the concept is similar across operating systems, the details differ.:

|OS|Home Directory|
|---|---|
|Linux/Ubuntu|`~/` or `/home/yourusername`|
|macOS|`~/` or `/Users/yourusername`|
|Windows|`C:\Users\yourusername`|

## Home Directory General Structure

For Linux, Windows, and macOS, the configuration files are in a hidden `.chia` folder. The application file location varies depending on your operating system.

### Unix-based systems (Linux, Ubuntu, etc.)
